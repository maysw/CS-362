Assignment 3
William Mays

1)	Random Test Card:
		- I decided to test the village card and got a code coverage of 24% 
		- Added errors variable to keep track of the errors
		- I ran 10000 tests and my tests were able to find 20 errors
		- Properly initialized with deckCount, discardCount, handCount and numActions
		
	
2)	Random Test Adventurer
		- I made some changes to the adventurer tester and got a code coverage of 23.45%
		- Ther are minor flaws in the debugging. Most of the time it will find errors, 
		but every once in a while it will not return an error. Clean it then compile again. 
		That should make it work
		- Treasure cards are added to the player's hand once played.
		- Plays adventurer card
